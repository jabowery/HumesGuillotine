# OckhamsGuillotine

This repository contains a series of contests (the first of which is at [LaboratoryOfTheCounties](https://github.com/jabowery/OckhamsGuillotine/tree/master/LaboratoryOfTheCounties)) to create the best unified model of society by compressing a wide range of social data.  Compression discovers causal laws by approximating the underlying Kolmogorov Complexity of the data.  This is inspired by <a href="http://prize.hutter1.net/">the Hutter Prize for Lossless Compression of Human Knowledge</a>
