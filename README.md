This repository contains a series of contests, inspired by <a href="http://prize.hutter1.net/">the Hutter Prize for Lossless Compression of Human Knowledge</a>, to a unified model of society by compressing a wide range of social data.  This approximates the discovery of causal laws by approximating the underlying Kolmogorov Complexity of the data.

Follow the chain of citations of a recent paper titled <a href="http://eda.mmci.uni-saarland.de/pubs/2016/origo-budhathoki,vreeken.pdf">Causal Inference by Compression</a> if you are interseted in the theory, practice and utility of compression to discover causality.
